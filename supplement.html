        <h3>Brief Instruction</h3>
        <p align="justify">Creatine is a natural substance found in muscle cells. It helps muscles produce energy during
          heavy lifting
          and high-intensity exercise. Research has proven that taking creatine can help in gaining muscle, enhancing
          strength and improving exercise performance. Factors like meat intake, exercise, amount of muscle mass,
          and levels of hormones can affect creatine stores in your body. Roughly 95% of creatine is stored in your
          muscles in the form of phosphocreatine, and the rest can be found in your brain, kidneys, and liver.

      <div class="work">
        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          Creatine increases your stores of phosphocreatine, a form of stored energy in cells, helping your body produce
          more of ATP, which is a high-energy molecule that acts as the body's energy currency. The more ATP you have in
          your body, the better you can perform during exercise. Creatine also alters several cellular processes
          that lead to increased muscle mass, strength, and recovery.

      <div class="introduction">
        <h3>Brief Instruction</h3>
        <p align="justify">Caffeine is a natural stimulant commonly found in tea, coffee, and cacao plants. It works by
          stimulating the brain and central nervous system, helping you to stay alert and preventing the tiredness.
          Caffeinated soft drinks hit the market in the late 1800s, and then comes the energy drinks. Nowadays, 80% of
          the world's population consumes caffeinated products each day, and this number goes up to 90% for adults in
          North America.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="work">
        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          Once consumed, caffeine is absorbed into the bloodstream from the gut. From there, it is passed to the liver
          and broken down into different compounds that affect the function of different organs. Caffeine's main effect
          is on the brain. It helps you stay awake by connecting to adenosine receptors in the brain without activating
          them, blocking the effects of adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired.

            dizziness, and vomiting.

      <div class="introduction">
        <h3>Brief Instruction</h3>
        <p align="justify">Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid, which means it is not used by your body to
          directly synthesize proteins. Together with another amino acid histidine, it produces a chemical called
          carnosine. Carnosine is stored in your skeletal muscles, helping reduce lactic acid accumulation in your
          muscles during exercise and therefore improving athletic performance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="work">
        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          In your muscles, histidine levels are normally high and beta-alanine levels low, which limits the production
          of carnosine. Supplementing with beta-alanine has been shown to increase carnosine levels in muscles by 80%.
          While you are exercising, lactate is produced, which as a result increases the acidity in your muscles,
          blocking glucose breakdown and reduces muscles’ ability to contract. Carnosine can buffer this rise in
          acidity, hence helping improve athletic performance.

    <section id="citrulline">
      <div class="introduction">
        <h3>Brief Instruction</h3>
        <p align="justify">Citrulline is an amino acid that your body can naturally produce on its own. You can increase
          the citrulline level in your body by eating foods containing it or by taking supplements. Citrulline has
          important roles in the body, especially in the urea cycle, which helps your body to get rid of harmful
          compounds. Citrulline can also help widen your blood vessels and may play a role in muscle building.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="work">
        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          One major way citrulline works is by increasing vasodilation--the widening of arteries or veins--which helps
          lower blood pressure and increase blood flow. After citrulline is consumed, some are converted to another
          amino acid called arginine. Arginine is converted into nitric oxides, which cause vasodilation of blood
          vessels. Moreover, although citrulline isn't an amino acid used directly to build proteins, research has shown
          that it can increase protein synthesis by stimulating an important signaling pathway involved in muscle
          building.

        <h3>Brief Instruction</h3>
        <p align="justify">BCAAs consist of three essential amino acids, Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine. BCAAs are
          considered essential because your body cannot make them. Therefore, it is important to get them from your diet
          or through supplements.

          BCAAs play several important roles. Firstly, BCAAs are mostly broken down in the muscle, rather than in the
          liver like most other amino acids. Therefore, they are considered to play an important role in energy
          production during a workout. Moreover, your body can use them as building blocks for protein and muscle. They
          may also be involved in regulating blood sugar level. In addition, BCAAs may help reduce the fatigue you feel
          during exercise by reducing the production of serotonin in your brain.
