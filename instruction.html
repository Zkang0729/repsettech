      Workout Structure
    </h1>
    <h4>By Joseph Gandolfo</h4>
    <div class="container" id="one">
      <p align="justify" class="first">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>orkout structure is important for anyone who is starting to
        exercise. After an
        intense
        workout, you will be sore
        and your body will be tired from the physical activity and the stress you put it under. Properly spacing your
        routines will make sure you have time to recover from each session and will help drastically reduce your chances
        of getting injured in the process. Workout structure helps you make sure you don’t undertrain or overtrain. If
        you
        hit all your muscle groups in one day, and are sore and out of the gym for a week, you won’t be able to perform
        as
        well and it will take a long time to hit your goals. If you train too much, you will not give your body enough
        time to
        rebuild itself and it can negatively affect your muscles and your hormones too.
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="second">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> great workout structure for beginners should include days where
        many parts of your body
        are included and aren’t
        that specific. You should also give yourself a good amount of rest throughout the week because your body will be
        sore due to the fact it is not used to the activities yet. It is important to stretch or foam roll parts of your
        body that are sore or tight after you workout to make sure it doesn’t affect you. Being tight and inflexible can
        put more stress on other parts of your body and may cause you to have bad form during your workouts. An example
        of
        a
        workout structure and one that will work well for beginners is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monday: Upper Body</li>
        <li>Tuesday: Lower Body</li>
        <li>Wednesday: Rest</li>
        <li>Thursday: Upper Body</li>
        <li>Friday: Lower Body</li>
        <li>Saturday: Core</li>
        <li>Sunday: Rest</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="container" id="two">
      <p align="justify" id="instruction">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>long with workout structure
        comes rep ranges,
        which is an individual structure
        to each exercise you are doing.
        Different rep ranges will have different effects on your muscles and your body. The main types of rep ranges
        are
        3-5, 8-12, and 15+.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="justify" id="firstp">
            <strong>3-5 Rep Range:</strong> This range is for your heaviest or hardest exercises. You should perform
            these safely, with
            good form, and a spotter if needed because it usually requires close to maximum effort from your body.
            This
            rep range will not help you gain muscle size or lose fat, but instead helps to increase your strength. It
            conditions your nervous system and tendons to be able to handle heavier loads. With training in this
            range,
            you will see your numbers go up in weight lifted and feel other exercises get a little easier. Because of
            the difficulty of the exercise, it also serves as a great way to burn fat. Your body continues to burn
            calories throughout the day and it raises your metabolism.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p align="justify" id="secondp">
            <strong>8-12 Rep Range:</strong> This range is for building up your muscles and making them grow. The 8-12
            range involves
            using a weight that is heavy for you but just enough in order to get a medium number of reps. The last
            reps
            in this range should be very difficult and should put the most stress on your muscles. These are the most
            important reps because its the time when the fibers in your muscle are most likely to break and tear so
            that
            they can go through the process of hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is the enlargement of tissues due to the
            increase in size of its cells.This is what causes your muscle to grow bigger and stronger when it recovers
            from the workout.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p align="justify" id="thridp">
            <strong>15+ Rep Range:</strong> This range is used for building up your muscle endurance and muscle tone. In
            this range you
            should be using little weight and many times be doing the exercise until failure, or until you can’t do
            any
            more reps. This helps you with your endurance because it trains your body and target muscle to deal with
            lactic acid that accumulates in the area throughout your sets. The better your body is at clearing out
            this
            acid, the longer it will be able to perform in the future. Because this rep range also provides a long
            time
            under tension, there is a lot of blood flow that is recruited during the set. This, along with the high
            count of stretches and contractions your muscle goes through, helps to form a toned muscle. A toned muscle
            does not necessarily mean there is less body fat in that area, but means that it is able to sit in a more
            contracted state when you are not doing anything. This gives the appearance that there is less fat because
            it is popping out more.
