          <h1>What was the hardest part about starting to go to the gym?</h1>
          <p align="justify">
            The hardest part was the first few workouts I had after going to the
            gym for the first time. My muscles were sore and I needed to
            increase the weights every workout. I couldn’t walk or move properly
            for the first week.
          </p>

        <div class="container" id="question2">
          <h1>How did you ease into working out?</h1>
          <p align="justify">
            Having a set schedule and a friend to work out with was what made it
            easy. Without a set schedule, I feel that I would either
            procrastinate or not feel motivated to go. Making workout a part of
            my daily schedule helped a lot. Furthermore, having a friend to go
            with me was not only made the workout fun in general but he also
            kept me in check.

          </h1>
          <p align="justify">
            Have a set schedule and make sure to follow it. Don’t overwork
            yourself because the faster you move up the weight, the harder it
            becomes and the less motivating it becomes. There is no reason to
            rush to take it slow. Also, finding a friend or gym partner to go
            with you might ensure the longevity of the workout.

          <h1>How did your nutrition change?</h1>
          <p align="justify">
            I tried not to make drastic changes to my diet. Suddenly changing
            the amount you eat or changing the type of food you eat might affect
            your weight in the short run but your body will ultimately return to
            its original state due to the yo-yo effect. I only cut out what was
            bad for me which included any drinks other than water and milk and
            decreased the amount of fried food. I also try to not eat anything
            after 10 P.M.

        <div class="container" id="question5">
          <h1>What are your goals?</h1>
          <p align="justify">
            My goal with my body is to become leaner and become stronger over a
            long period of time. This would mean controlling my diet and working
            out with routine. My ultimate goal is to get into a habit of
            exercising and working out so that it carries over to when I am
            older.

            know?

          <p align="justify">
            This will be very case by case, but in general anyone new to a gym
            setting should know they need to be patient, have realistic goals,
            and to keep safety in mind at all times.

          <p align="justify">
            It depends what makes someone start going to the gym, but motivation
            and intimidation in the gym setting are probably two of the biggest
            factors many people have to overcome when starting to workout.

            This will vary person to person too. Some people find putting
            gym/workout time on their calendar helps with accountability. If
            possible, having a buddy meeting you to workout also helps.

            If possible, working out with someone who is familiar with exercise
            is a great option. Having someone who can help keep an eye on your
            form is very helpful. If you workout alone, keeping your ego in line
            and don’t worry about how much weight you are doing, but rather than
            anything you do you are doing correctly will help prevent injuries.
            Not taking on too much too fast will help as well. Always listen to
            your body if rest or recovery are needed.

        <h1>Tips For Different Workout Goals</h1>
        <div class="section" id="stronger">
          <h3>Getting Stronger</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            If you want to strictly get stronger, the assumption is that you are
            lifting weights or something along the lines of that. It is harder
            to get stronger without gaining weight/muscle because, at a certain
            point, your body will reach its peak strength levels. In order to
            become stronger, your muscles must tear and rebuild larger than
            before. This means you will gain weight. Assuming you have a
            rigorous enough workout routine (at least 3 days a week with heavier
            weights), the first nutritional step you should take is to go to the
            calorie calculator mentioned earlier to find your maintenance
            caloric intake. In order to get stronger, you will need to build
            muscle, so it’s recommended that you try to add about 500 calories
            to your caloric intake. This usually will guarantee a gain in weight
            and muscle mass. A good way to keep track of all of this is the app
            <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">MyFitnessPal</a>. It shows
            you what macronutrients you need for each day and you can input the
            foods you eat to make sure you hit those goals. It can also track
            your weight so you can see if you’re gaining weight or not. If
            things aren’t going smoothly, you can adjust the settings or your
            goals.

          <h3>Gain Weight</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            If you are looking to strictly gain weight, the only thing you need
            to do is eat 500 more calories per day than your maintenance caloric
            intake and use the app mentioned to keep track of your progress.

        <div class="section" id="muscle">
          <h3>Build Muscle</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            If you want to mainly build muscle, there isn’t much room to be
            super unhealthy with your diet. IIFYM won’t yield the best results
            because there are many processed foods and simple sugars that could
            lead to fat gain (fruits, sugar, white bread, soda, syrup, baked
            treats, and kid’s cereal). It is impossible for a regular person
            with a regular body to gain muscle without gaining any fat unless
            maybe if you already had the muscle before and you’re regaining it,
            but this website is for beginners. If you are a beginner on the more
            overweight side of the spectrum, it is possible to lose fat and gain
            muscle at the same time. But as a regular person, if you want to
            gain the least amount of fat possible while still building muscle,
            you need to stay extremely disciplined in your workout routine and
            diet. If you’re gaining weight too fast, decrease the amount of
            added calories to your maintenance caloric intake.

          <h3>Lose Weight</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            If you want to strictly lose weight, eat about 500 fewer calories
            per day than your maintenance caloric intake. If this is too much of
            a difference, you can ease into it by starting out with -100
            calories. Exercise isn’t necessarily required to lose weight, but
            it’s easier if you do exercise. Exercise will burn calories, which
            means it’s easier for you to eat fewer net calories in a day.

        <div class="section" id="fat">
          <h3>Lose Fat</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            Losing fat requires a certain amount of discipline because it means
            that you want to keep most, if not all of the muscle, you have now
            and only cut the fat. As mentioned in the above bullet, you have to
            eat fewer calories, but in order to make sure your muscles don’t
            disappear, you should increase your protein intake. This protein
            intake is referring to the amount recommended by the app mentioned
            earlier or, to make it simple, 1 gram of protein per lb of body
            weight (1.5 grams if you are skinnier). So for example, you could go
            from 220 grams to 250 grams of protein a day.

          <h4>
            There are some specific diets that are popular for losing fat.
          </h4>

            <li align="justify">
              Intermittent Fasting - “an eating pattern that cycles between
              periods of fasting and eating”. You can basically eat anything you
              want, but it has to be within a certain window. If you want the
              best results, it’s best to eat healthier foods. The most common
              method is the 16/8 method which is when you restrict your eating
              to only 8 hours of the day. This is usually from noon to about
              8:00 pm, but it all depends on your preference.
            </li>
            <li align="justify">
              The Ketogenic Diet - “The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb,
              high-fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and
              low-carb diets. It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate
              intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts
              your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. When this
              happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for
              energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can
              supply energy for the brain.”

            Be Healthy This is pretty broad because it all depends on what your
            perception of healthy is. This section uses a common consensus when
            it comes to being healthy. Healthy is being within your recommended
            weight range, exercising on a consistent basis, and eating more
            organic/“real” foods and less processed foods.
