            “A particular selection of food, especially as designed or

            Dieting doesn’t always mean losing weight, which is a big
            misconception &mdash; It can mean simply changing the
            contents/properties of the food you’re eating
          </li>
          <li>
            A diet for someone who wants to lose weight will be different than
            one for someone who wants to gain muscle for example.

          You May Have Different Goals. Here Are Some Tips...
        </h1>
        <div class="muscle">
          <h3>Gaining Muscle</h3>
          <ul align="justify">
            <li>
              Eat many times - about 5 - a day to make it easier to get all of
              the calories you need.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you don’t want to constantly track your calories, create a meal
              plan where you have basically the same meals every day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drink whey protein powder shakes (make sure they have good
              ingredients). This makes it easier to hit your protein levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plan and cook your meals ahead of time so that you don’t have to
              cook every time you want to eat
            </li>
            <li id="breakfast">
              Eat breakfast
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="healthy">
          <h3>Staying Healthy/Losing Weight</h3>
          <ul align="justify">
            <li>
              Only drink water - This is very simple, but it will cut out a lot
              of unnatural ingredients in things like soda and alcohol. Also, if
              you are trying to stay a certain weight or lose weight, this will
              cut out a lot of calories.
            </li>
            <li>
              No fried food - Fried food has a lot of calories, particularly fat
              calories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to eat complex carbohydrates - These are foods like oatmeal,
              rice, whole grain bread, potatoes, quinoa, and beans. They digest
              slower than simple carbs, which makes it easier to stay full
            </li>
            <li>
              Have cheat days - It’s great to eat completely healthy all year,
              but realistically, this is extremely hard for most people. Having
              a cheat day once a week will keep you motivated because it acts as
              a reward for eating well. A cheat day doesn’t mean you should eat
              the most unhealthy foods ever made. Still, use common sense.
